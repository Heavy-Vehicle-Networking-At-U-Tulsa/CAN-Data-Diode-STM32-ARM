# CAN Data Security Diode STM32 ARM
The code and documentation in this repository support a version of the CAN Data Security Diode that uses an ARM Cortex-M0 Processor with a CAN Controller made by ST. The specific chip use in this design is the [STM32F042K4](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-mainstream-mcus/stm32f0-series/stm32f0x2/stm32f042k4.html).


## Source Code
The source code in this repository is built on [Example Code snippets](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcus-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32snippets/stm32snippetsf0.html) covering STM32 F0 series.

## Hardware Documentation
The [documentation for the hardware](docs/README.md) includes schematics, production, files and original Altium Designer files.

## Acknowledgments
The authors and designers would like to acknowledge the support of the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. (NMFTA) in creating this device. Their leadership in the promoting and improving cybersecurity of heavy vehiles should not go unnoticed.
