# CAN-Data-Diode-STM32-ARM
The code and documentation in this repository support a version of the CAN Data Security Diode that uses an ARM Cortex-M0 Processor with a CAN Controller made by ST. The specific chip use in this design is the [STM32F042K4](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-mainstream-mcus/stm32f0-series/stm32f0x2/stm32f042k4.html).


## Source Code
The source code in this repository is built on [Example Code snippets](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcus-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32snippets/stm32snippetsf0.html) covering STM32 F0 series.

## Hardware Documentation
The [documentation for the hardware](docs/README.md) includes schematics, production, files and original Altium Designer files.
