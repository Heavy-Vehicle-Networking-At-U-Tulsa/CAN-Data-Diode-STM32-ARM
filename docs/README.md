# CAN Data Diode Production Files and Documentation

This documentation directly focuses on the hardware design and production of the CAN Data Diode.

So long as the terms of the license are met, you can use these production and documentation files to fabricate, evaluate, and test the CAN Data Diode. 


## Documentation
The documentation consists of the following documents:

  1. The schematic drawing of the circuit used for the CAN Data Diode with the STM32F0 processors.
  1. A Bill of Materials in MS Excel and PDF formats.

## Production Files
The production files contain a zip compressed folder with the Gerber files, pick-and-place files, bill of materials, and NC drill files. This single zip file can be sent to an electronics fabrication facility for a full turn-key prodution. For example, Electronic Manufacturing Solutions, Inc. out of Lincoln, AR can produce these boards with the contents of this production file.

## Altium Files
The printed circuit board project files including the PCB layout and schematic are available. This is the so-called source code of the hardware for the CAN Data Diode. 

## Errata
On the first run articles produced in 2018, the Diodes D1 and D2 were mounted backwards. After orienting them correctly, the system powers on correctly.
